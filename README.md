# Web Monitoring

Long things short - you're on the wrong git branch if you want to work on the repo.

Run either of the following:

- ```git checkout -t origin/server```; if you want to work on the server part
- ```git checkout -t origin/webnode_py```; if you want to work on the client part

## Overview

Web monitoring is a nightmare...

Poor's man web monitoring is easy, but not scalable nor easily maintanable:

- add a cron job
- add a script
- get some stats
- consolidate
- (black box)
- money! - or at least .. you know when your servers are dead :) that's not that bad after all

Real man's web monitoring is expensive, you are allowed to:

- perform X web check
- from X nodes
- on an average amount of nodes
- (black box)
- money! - I know double joke doesn't make it through, but .. at least you got nice stats and you know when your servers are dead and ++

WM is here to cover those issues!

WM is a distributed web monitoring check, the more resources you will share, the bigger the network will grow and will be accurate, from a statistical perspective (more web nodes, hence more data), and from a geographical stand point (.. still more web nodes spread around the world!)

You want more checks? Become part of the network! The more you contribute, the more free resources you will get for your own checks.
You want more source of checks? Become part of the network! The more you contribute, the more free resources you will get for your own checks.
You want more money? Get a job, or change job!

WM (will) provide(s):

- large panel of web nodes
- geographically spread panel of web nodes
- contribution interest for web noders
- all the cool stuff of a real web monitoring platform; and more (no casino, blackjack tables or ... though)
