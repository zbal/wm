# Webmonit-report

Generate reports of all kind.

Currently reports are generated on the fly and clearly lack optimization. No caching currently involved nor local storage; it is mostly expected (for now) to be used as JSON source for web clients.

## Attributes

Name | Field | Required | Allowed Values | Type | Description 
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
ID | id | true | check, node | string | Used to identify the type of report to generate

## Methods

### CRUD (fake)

Only support read method.

Rely on query parameters to generate the reports.

### API - query parameters

Use regular GET query parameters: 

```
http://example.com/api/Report/TYPE?param1=value1&param2=value2
```

Parameter | Allowed Values | Required | Description
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- 

## Reports type
Define the type of reports, expected arguments and report.

__Notes__;

- Security is not considered yet, filtering based on ACL will be handled later, data will also be anonymized
- This is only a PoC; don't expect things to be useful ;)
